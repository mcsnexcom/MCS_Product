> The **MUT (MCU Utility Tools) SDK** is based on service/client framework. The MUT service of the MUT SDK can serve multiple client programs developed using client API at the same time. Besides, the MUT SDK also can support standalone program if you didnâ€™t want to use service/client framework. So far, it already supports a lot of MCS products.

# **Instroduction**
The **MUT (MCU Utility Tools) SDK** is based on service/client framework. The MUT service of the MUT SDK can serve multiple client programs developed using client API at the same time. Besides, the MUT SDK also can support standalone program if you didnâ€™t want to use service/client framework. So far, it already supports a lot of MCS products.

The MUT SDK can control peripherals devices or I/O using API provided. It also supports our own CAN module simulated using MCU device.

There are two files in the MUT SDK, **MUT_SDK** and **FLASH_MCU**. Both of them are briefly described as follows. More of information will expose in chapter 3 and chapter 

- MUT_SDK : Most important part of MUT SDK. In the files, you can use tools to get/set MCU and CAN data.
- Flash_MCU : Use to update MCU firmware
